One of the UK's last working windmills (or at least, it will be when the sails are fixed), George Green Sr. was also the father of mathematician George Green. As well as a tour of the mill, there's a sensory garden small science centre which features Green's Theorem and several electromagnetism interactives. 

Entry is free, and it's a good way to spend an hour or two in Nottingham.
