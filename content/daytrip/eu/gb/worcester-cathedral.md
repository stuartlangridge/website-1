Worcester Cathedral is stunning - a proper medieval masterpiece perched on the River Severn with King John's tomb and some cracking Norman architecture. The mix of styles from Norman to Gothic works brilliantly, and that cloister is genuinely impressive. 

It's well worth a visit if you're in the area, especially for the spectacular medieval stained glass.
