FAST (Farnborough Air Sciences Trust) is a volunteer-run charity museum that's been showcasing Farnborough's aviation heritage since 1993. 

Housed in a 1908 building that once served as headquarters for the Royal Engineers Balloon School, overlooking Farnborough Airfield where you can watch modern aircraft while exploring historic gems like Sir Frank Whittle's early jet engines and Concorde research models. 

They have half a million artefacts in their collection and displays rotating, it's a proper treasure trove of British aviation history that punches well above its weight for a volunteer-led operation. 

Plus, they've got the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service, which is basically the aviation equivalent of getting a gold star from your nan!
