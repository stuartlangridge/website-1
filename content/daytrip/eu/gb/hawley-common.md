Hawley Common is a woodland space used by walkers, dog walkers, cyclists, and sailors. At the centre is Hawley Lake, which the linked sailing club uses. The lake is very pleasant to walk around, and through the surrounding woods.

The 3rd Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME) group at "Hawley Hard" also uses the lake for bridge-building exercises.
