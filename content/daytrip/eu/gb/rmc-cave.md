Run by Neil from the RMC YouTube channel, and cast of other experts and volunteers.

Great half or full day out playing with old computers and arcade games.

Plenty to see in the museum, and enough devices to occupy your time with "just one more play", like the old days.

The arcade in the basement is dark, hot, and fully equipped with plenty of classic games, and some I'd never seen.

There's a nice little cafe just up the road - "Lavender Bakehouse & Coffee Shop"
